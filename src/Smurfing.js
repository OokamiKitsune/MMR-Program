// Detect MMR/stats exploit
// There should be a conservative limit on how much MMR a player can gain or lose in a single match.
// This is to prevent players from exploiting the system by intentionally losing matches to lower their MMR,
// then winning matches to gain a lot of MMR. This is known as smurfing.
